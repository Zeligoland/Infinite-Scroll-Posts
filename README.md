# Infinite-Scroll-Posts
Fetch, Async/Await, CSS Loader

## Notes

- In this project we are going to fetch five posts and there will be a CSS loader that is going to load more posts. In this project we use JSONPlaceholder which is a fake rest API.

- The way this project works is that when we hit a certain point in our scroll, it'll fetch the next batch of posts from the API.

- The project has a filter implemented.
